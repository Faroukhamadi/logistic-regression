# logistic-regression

This is a simple implementation of logistic regression in Python. It uses x_1 and x_2 to predict the y using the Sigmoid function. Newton-Raphson is the predictor to find the optimal theta for the cost function.

## Usage

Run the [notebook](./logistic_regression_notebook.ipynb)  in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

## implementation details

You can find the implementation details in the logistic_regression.py file.
